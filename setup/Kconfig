        string "Local version - append to kernel release"
        default ""
        help
          Append an extra string to the end of your kernel version.
          This will show up when you type uname, for example.
          The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
          any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
          object and source tree, in that order.

        default y
        help
          This is the processor type of your CPU. This is used to optimize
          performance. If you have a mixed system, you can select the CPU
          type that you have.

    config ENABLE_SMP
        bool "Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) support"
        default n
        help
          This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
          a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
          than one CPU, say Y.

menu "Memory Management"

    config ENABLE_PAGING
        bool "Paging support"
        default y
        help
          This option enables the kernel to use paging to manage memory.
          Paging is a memory management scheme that allows the physical
          address space of a process to be noncontiguous.

    config ENABLE_VM
        bool "Virtual Memory"
        default y
        depends on ENABLE_PAGING
        help
          This option enables the virtual memory system, which allows
          each process to have its own virtual address space.

        default y
        help
          This option enables the kernel's process scheduler. The scheduler
          is responsible for deciding which runnable process will be executed
          by the CPU next.

    if ENABLE_SCHEDULER

    config ENABLE_CFS_SCHEDULER
        bool "CFS Scheduler (Completely Fair Scheduler)"
        default y
        help
          This is the default scheduler used by the kernel. It handles CPU
          resource allocation for executing processes, with the goal of
          maximizing overall CPU utilization while maximizing interactive
          performance.

    config ENABLE_RR_SCHEDULER
        bool "Round-Robin Scheduler"
        default n
        help
          A simple scheduler that assigns time slices to each process in
          equal portions and in order, handling all processes without priority.
          Not currently implemented.

    config ENABLE_PRIORITY_SCHEDULER
        bool "Priority Scheduler"
        default n
        help
          A priority-based scheduler where each process is assigned a priority
          and the process with the highest priority is allowed to run first.
          Not currently implemented.

    config TICK_RATE_HZ
        int "Timer frequency (Hz)"
        range 100 1000
        default 100
        help
          The frequency of the system timer interrupt, in Hz. Higher values
          result in better timekeeping precision at the cost of more
          frequent interrupts and thus higher overhead.

menu "File Systems"

    config ENABLE_VFS
        bool "Virtual File System (VFS) support"
        default y
        help
          This option provides a unified interface for different file systems.
          It allows the kernel to support multiple file system types.

    if ENABLE_VFS

    config ENABLE_MINIX_FS
        bool "Minix file system support"
        default y
        help
          Minix is a simple file system used in the Minix operating system.
          It's useful for small disks and embedded systems.

    config ENABLE_RAMDISK
        bool "RAM disk support"
        default y
        help
          Support for RAM disk devices that can be used for temporary storage
          or as an initial root file system during boot.

              This enables support for serial ports, which can be used for
              console output and debugging.

        config ENABLE_KEYBOARD_DRIVER
            bool "Keyboard driver"
            default y

          This enables kernel debugging features. These features are useful
          for kernel developers but may impact performance.

        int "Debug level (0-3)"
        range 0 3
